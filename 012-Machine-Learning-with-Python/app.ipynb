    "1. `Import the Data` - This step involves loading the dataset you'll use to train and test your model, often from CSV, Excel, or a database. It's the foundation for building any machine learning solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Clean the Data` - Real-world data is often messyâ€”this step involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and converting data into a usable format (e.g., numbers instead of text).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Split the Data into Training / Test Sets` - The data is divided into a training set (used to build the model) and a test set (used to evaluate its performance). This ensures the model is tested on unseen data to check its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Create a Model` - You choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, or neural network) to solve your specific problem, like predicting prices or classifying images.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Train the Model` - The model learns patterns in the training data by adjusting its internal parameters to minimize errors. This is where the actual learning happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Make Predictions` - After training, you use the model to make predictions on new, unseen data (typically the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Evaluate and Improve` - You assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, or mean squared error. Based on the results, you might tune parameters, use a different algorithm, or improve the data quality to get better results."
