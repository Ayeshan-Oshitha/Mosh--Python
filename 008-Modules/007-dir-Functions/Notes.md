Using the `dir()` function, we can list all attributes and methods of an object, module, or package. It provides a way to inspect the contents of any object in Python.

```python
import math

# List all attributes and methods in the math module
print(dir(math))

```

We can use `dir()` not only with built-in methods or classes, but also with our custom classes.
